The site features a modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS, leveraging React.js at its core to create dynamic user interfaces and single-page applications. By utilizing these technologies, the website ensures a robust, scalable, and efficient user experience. \n The codebase is hosted on GitHub, where it is managed and versioned for easy collaboration and updates. GitHub Actions automate the build and deployment processes, ensuring continuous integration and delivery. This setup allows for seamless management and quick implementation of updates, ensuring the site remains up-to-date and functional. The project is organized into well-structured directories for workflows, public assets, and source code, promoting maintainability and scalability.",

To provide better control, it supports a .compose-ignore file, allowing users to exclude specific directories. This project highlights my expertise in Rust development, CLI tooling, filesystem traversal, process automation, and Docker integration, making containerized environments easier to manage.",

It works across multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and BSDs. The project isn't officially endorsed by Obsidian but provides a robust solution for converting and managing Obsidian vault content.
